## A Showcase Of HTML And CSS
I created this website without any frameworks or libraries; it's
just plain old HTML and CSS with a little bit of Javascript for 
fading in the navbar. 

The only extra I did use is the CSS extension language
[SASS](https://sass-lang.com). I would recommend using this if
you're going to be heavily using CSS
in your project. I found it very easy to pick up.

## Why did I create a personal website?
There are three main purposes to this site:
1. An 'online CV' which I can link to on my actual CV document.
2. To teach myself some basic front-end skills since I don't usually
do very much web development.
3. To serve as a portal to my [blog](https://blog.gsbaker.uk).
