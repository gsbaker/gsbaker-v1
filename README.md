My personal website, version 1! 

## How it's built
I decided to use the Bootstrap front-end CSS library because of its easy to implement layout options. 

For any custom CSS I used [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) to make my life easier. 

## Purpose of this site
I want this website to act as an extension to my CV. It allows me to go more in depth on projects I've done 
than I am able to do on my CV.
