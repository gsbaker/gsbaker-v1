Hello there! 👋🏻 I'm George.

I love making simple, clean and elegant software. Right now, I'm focussing on iOS and web development.

Apart from coding, I enjoy playing tennis, listening to alternative/indie music and supporting West Bromwich
 Albion FC. If you would like to know more about me, visit my [website](https://www.gsbaker.uk) or the 
 [about page](https://blog.gsbaker.uk/about/) on my [blog](https://blog.gsbaker.uk).
